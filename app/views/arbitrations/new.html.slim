          | I purchased a desk through RDN.  When it arrived at my office, I unpacked it and set it up.  
            After using it for a month, I notice that the back left corner of the desk was chipped.  Since that part of the desk is in a corner of my office, 
            it cannot be the responsibility of the cleaning people or some other event.  It must have arrived with the chip and I just did not notice it. 
            Now I would like to return it and get a new desk ($500) or get a discount off of the price.  The manufacturer refuses to pay for anything.
