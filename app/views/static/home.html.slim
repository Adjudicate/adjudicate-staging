          br
          |Our process rests on one basic principle that has been proven through statistical analysis time and time again: that two heads are better than one â€“ 
            and that fifty are better than eleven-or-less.  
            In a typical dispute, your case may be heard by a single judge, 
            a panel of three arbitrators, or a jury of eleven people.  
            At Adjudicate Online, more than fifty people experience and trained in arbitration will be asked to review your case, register a 
            vote, and justify their decision in writing.
