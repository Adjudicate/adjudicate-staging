            |At Adjudicate Online, we exist for one purpose: to improve the way we resolve disputes. We offer
             dispute resolution that is cheaper, faster, and fairer than any other option available. Using Adjudicate
             Online is similar to going to court, except you'll save tens of thousands of dollars, you'll spend weeks
             instead of years, and, most of all, your voice will be heard.

            |How It Works
          p.bottom-content
            br
            |Our process includes the basic statistical principle: that two heads are better than one â€“ and that fifty
             are better than twelve-or- less. In a typical dispute, your case may be heard by a single judge, a panel of
             three arbitrators, or a jury of twelve people. At Adjudicate Online, critical issues are heard by a crowd,
             made up of a statistically significant number of trained arbitrators with a history of keeping private
             information confidential. The arbitrators will review your case, register their position, and explain their decision.
