            |How It Works

            br
            |Our process rests on one basic principle that is based on proven statistical theory: that two heads are better than one â€“ 
              and that fifty are better than twelve-or-less.  
              In a typical dispute, your case may be heard by a single judge, 
              a panel of three arbitrators, or a jury of twelve people.  
              At Adjudicate Online, a crowd, made up of a statistically significant number of trained arbitrators with a history 
              of keeping private information confidential - will be asked to review your case, register their 
              position, and explain their position in writing.
